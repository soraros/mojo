### ✨ Highlights

### Language enhancements

Literals now have a default type. For example, you can now bind
`[1,2,3]` to `T` in a call to a function defined as
 `fn zip[T: Iterable](impl:T)` because it will default to the
 standard library's List type.

### Language changes

### Standard library changes

- Added `unsafe_get`, `unsafe_swap_elements` and `unsafe_subspan` to `Span`.

- The deprecated `DType.index` is now removed in favor of the `DType.int`.

- `math.isqrt` has been renamed to `rsqrt` since it performs reciprocal square
  root functionality.

- Added `swap_pointees` function to `UnsafePointer` as an alternative to `swap`
  when the pointers may potentially alias each other.

- `memcpy` and `parallel_memcpy` without keyword arguments are deprecated.

- The `math` package now has a mojo native implementation of `acos`, `asin`,
  `cbrt`, and `erfc`.

- Added support for NVIDIA GeForce GTX 970.

- Added support for NVIDIA Jetson Thor.

- `Optional` now conforms to `Iterable` and `Iterator` acting as a collection of
  size 1 or 0.

### Tooling changes

- Error messages now preserve symbolic calls to `always_inline("builtin")`
  functions rather than inlining them into the error message.

### ❌ Removed

### 🛠️ Fixed

- The `math.cos` and `math.sin` function can now be evaluated at compile time
  (fixes #5111).
