    Protocol for a minimal, non-blocking push queue interface in MAX.

    This protocol defines the contract for a queue that supports non-blocking
    put operations for adding items. It is generic over the item type and designed
    for scenarios where the caller must be immediately notified of success or failure
    rather than waiting for space to become available.

    The protocol is intended for producer-side queue operations where immediate
    feedback is critical for proper flow control and error handling.

        Attempt to put an item into the queue without blocking.

        This method is designed to immediately fail (typically by raising an exception)
        if the item cannot be added to the queue at the time of the call. Unlike the
        traditional 'put' method in many queue implementations—which may block until
        space becomes available or the transfer is completed—this method never waits.
        It is intended for use cases where the caller must be notified of failure to
        enqueue immediately, rather than waiting for space.
