# Many of the generated overloads for constructors are more specialized in
# C++ than they are in Python. For example, `int32_t` and `int64_t` and `size_t`
# all map to `int` in Python typing. It may not always be clear which of these
# overloads will be run for a given set of inputs (though in most cases it's the first one)
# but we disable mypy errors for shadowed overloads.
#
# mypy: disable-error-code="overload-cannot-match"

# DiagnosticHandlers aren't a thing that Python can reasonably provided. In most cases
# these are automatically provided, but there are a few custom verifiers not covered yet.
# This binding prevents errors in those cases.
DiagnosticHandler = Callable

# This is a bug I haven't yet chased down in Nanobind's type renderings.
# - In some circumstances, `max._core.dialicts.mosh.ShapeType` is being shortened
#   to `h.ShapeType`, which obviously doesn't exist.
# - I haven't figured out a clean repro or workaround, I suspect it's some awkward case
#   with `nb_func_render_signature` because for instance adding garbage characters to the
#   `const_name` in the type caster will cause it to repro in different places.
# - For now, really hacky thing to work around.

    Give names to the input dimensions of inputs.

    This is done by passing a list of strings where inputs are delimited by ","
    and dimensions within an input are delimited by ";".

    The character '-' is reserved for dimensions we don't care about renaming.
    For example, to set the first dimension of two inputs equal to each other
    without touching the remaining values we would pass in:
      --dim-names="BATCH;-;-,BATCH;-;-"

    This will result the first dimension renamed something like "REFINE_BATCH".

    Dimensions with the same name have the same value at runtime.

    We use this fact to make input shapes more specific:

    Example1:
      [4, ?, ?], [?, ?, ?], refined with --dim-names="A;B;C,A;C;B" will become:
      [4, B, C], [4, C, B]... (since 4 = A, and 4 is more "specific").

    With "specificity" increasing with the following symbols:
       ? (least specific) --> D1 --> 4 (integer, most specific)

    Example2:
      [3, 2, 5, ?, ?, 3], [3, 2, ?, 4, ?, 3], with
        dim-names="-;-;A;B;-;-,-;-;A;B;-;-"

      [3, 2, 5, 4, ?, 3], [3, 2, 5, 4, ?, 3] as the last ? had no name due to
